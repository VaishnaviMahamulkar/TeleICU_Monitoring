# TeleICU_Monitoring
It's My first repository on GitHub.

The TeleICU Monitoring System is an innovative project designed to monitor and classify individuals in an ICU environment using deep learning and video processing techniques. This system helps in identifying patients, doctors or nurses, and family members, as well as detecting specific patient movements such as breathlessness, limb movement, falling, or attempting to wake up.

# Features

- **Person Classification**: Identifies and classifies individuals in the ICU as patients, doctors or nurses, or family members.
- **Patient Activity Detection**: Monitors and detects specific patient movements and activities.
- **Alert System**: Sends alerts to the medical team based on detected patient activities.
